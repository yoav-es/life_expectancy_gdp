# GDP vs. Life Expectancy Visualization Project

This project analyzes global GDP and life expectancy data to explore how economic development relates to public health.  
It uses Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn for data analysis and visualization.

Features:
- Calculates average life expectancy across all countries
- Summarizes GDP and life expectancy statistics by country (mean, min, max)
- Visualizes trends and distributions using line plots, bar charts, and scatter plots
- Computes Pearson correlation between GDP and life expectancy
- Highlights how visualizations reveal patterns and outliers

Usage:
Clone the repository:
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/gdp_life_expectancy.git
cd gdp_life_expectancy

Install requirements (if needed):
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn 

Place your dataset (e.g. gdp_life_expectancy.csv) in the project directory.

Run the analysis:
python main.py

Files:
- main.py — Main analysis script
- gdp_life_expectancy.csv — Data file (not included; obtain from your source)

Data Source:
This project uses GDP and life expectancy data compiled from public datasets (e.g. World Bank, WHO, or Kaggle sources).
